# Documentation
<a id="top"></a>
This documentation is for the frontend of the [Pick-by-Light](https://github.com/PBL-Pick-By-Light) project. The system was developed during the module "Softwaretechnik-Projekt" at the [THM Gie√üen](https://www.thm.de).

## Frontend
<a id="frontend"></a>
The graphical user interface allows the user to interact with the system. A login system ensures that only authorized users can use the system. The desired parts are selected via a search mask and displayed via the further connection. Extended setting options are available to the administrator. Parts and shelfs can be created and managed.

From a technical point of view, the frontend is realized with [vue](https://vuejs.org) and [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en) and is running in a [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) docker container. The different components are presented on individual pages. 

## Install-guide
<a id="install"></a>
The frontend can be started via [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

The docker commands must be used in the location of the "Dockerfile" file.

Before the build, the ip to the backend can be adjusted in the `config/config.json`.
Further adjustments for the nginx server can be configured in the `config/nginx.conf`, but are usually not necessary.
#### Build Docker-Image
```
docker build . -t frontend
```

#### First time build and run container
The port used by the webserver can be specified within the command. Default is `8080`.<br>(`80` is the port of the nginx server running in the container and defined in the `config/nginx.conf`)
```
docker run --name frontend -d -p 8080:80 frontend
```

#### Start or stop container after first run
```
docker start frontend
docker stop frontend
```
#### Development
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

- __authDataService__<br>Allows registering of new users, logs existing users in and makes the corresponding data available for the frontend components
- __http-common__<br>Imports Axios and sets the url to the backend systems
- __http-embedded__<br>Imports Axios and sets the url to the embedded systems
